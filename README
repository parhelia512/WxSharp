== MacOS, Linux and other *nix ==
=== Build ===
1. Install mono
2. Install wxWdigets
3. Install SWIG
4. Build project
  > mkdir build && cd build
  > cmake ..
  > make

=== Install Mono on MacOS ===
Mono for MacOS can be downloded with Xamarin Studio from https://xamarin.com/download
Another way (not tested), is install with Homebrew
> brew install mono

=== Install wxWidgets on MacOS ===
> brew install wxmac

=== Build wxWidgets by hand on MacOS ===
This shouldn't be needed as wxmac from Homebrew with universal libs (i386 and x86_64) and so can be used with 32 bit mono from Xamarin Studio.
> git clone git@github.com:wxWidgets/wxWidgets.git
> cd wxWidgets
> git checkout WX_3_0_BRANCH
> mkdir build && cd build
> ../configure --enable-universal-binary=i386,x86_64 --enable-debug --enable-monolithic
> make && make install

=== Install SWIG on MacOS ===
> brew install swig
